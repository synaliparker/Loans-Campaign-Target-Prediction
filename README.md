## Project Summary
To help in designing the loan campaign for converting the existing customers to liability customers by building a classification model that identifies the existing customers that are more likely to buy a loan.

### Skills and Tools
Logistic Regression, Classification, Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Description

### Data Description:

The dataset contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic
information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities
account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan).
Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to
them in the earlier campaign.
 
### Context:

This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting
its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A
campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of
over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns
with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.

- Credit card: Does the customer use a credit card issued by the bank?

### Objective:

- The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans.

### Learning Outcomes:
